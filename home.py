    This app is a deep dive analysis of the air quality parameters over the years in India. Also it provides a detailed view of 
    current live air quality stats and allow user to compare them in different ways. The app tried to show 
    every dimension possible to understand the air quality in India.
            
    There are many hidden facts and relations that were found during the analysis of the data and which are vital to
    have a better understanding of the air quality in India. The app is designed to show all those facts and relations
    in a very intuitive way.
